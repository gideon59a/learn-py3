Purpose: Show how asyncio aiohttp can support multiple concurrent request (although a single process is yet used)
The code is based on chatGPT.

How to:
# python server.py

and concurrently in each of two other windows:
# python client.py

The server gets both requests. But, as each task takes 10sec cpu and a single process handles them all,
the aggregate time is 40sec although each client needs just 20sec processing!
See the websocket-uvicorn for how to run in parallel.
